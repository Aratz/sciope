This example implements the model described in:

Vilar, Jos√© MG, Hao Yuan Kueh, Naama Barkai, and Stanislas Leibler. 
"Mechanisms of noise-resistance in genetic oscillators." 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 99, no. 9 (2002): 5988-5992.

The model is implemented in the gillespy package:
https://github.com/JohnAbel/gillespy

gillespy in turn uses the StochSS/StochKit framework:

Please ensure gillespy and matplotlib are installed before running this example.
