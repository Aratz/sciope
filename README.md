The (M)odeling, (I)inference and (O)ptimization toolbox is a Python 2 package for performing model-assisted inference and optimization.

### What can the MIO toolbox do? ###

* Surrogate Modeling: 
	- train fast metamodels of computationally expensive problems
	- perform surrogate-assisted model reduction for large-scale models/simulators (e.g., biochemical reaction networks)
* Inference: 
	- perform likelihood-free parameter inference using surrogate modeling or Bayesian optimization
	- perform efficient parameter sweeps based on statistical designs and sampling techniques
* Optimization: 
	- optimize a specified objective function or surrogate model using a variety of approaches
	
* Version 0.1
